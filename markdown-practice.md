# Heading Level 1 - use one #
## Heading Level 2 - use 2 ##'s

Tip:
Put a blank line before a  

##### Heading (this is Heading 4, btw)  

and after.

For paragraphs, don't use tabs in front. Just keep text left-aligned.  

To create a line break...  
end a line with two spaces  
and hit return.

But sometimes spaces are hard to see.  
So if your application supports HTML, you can use the  ```<br>``` <br>HTML tag.

**Bold** something usig 2 *'s on both sides of the word or phrase.  
*Italicize* with just 1 * before and after.  
***Bold Italic*** with 3 *'s!!

For a block quote, add a > in front of the paragraph.  
> Like this if you want it to be a block.

Code blocks get 4 spaces or one tab:
```  
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Test</title>
        </head>
```
Or just add ``` before and after the code snipet.
